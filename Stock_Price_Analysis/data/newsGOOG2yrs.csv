27,2021-01-25 08:54:00-08:00,Google see progress on cookie replacement effort; union effort moves forward,"Google (GOOG -1%, GOOGL -0.9%) is making progress on its replacement for the advertising ""cookie"" - the small bit of code placed on the devices of Web users to ensure ad targeting is working. After a number of privacy concerns and policy changes at the likes of Apple threaten to disrupt the large market for third-party data, Google is seeing promising signs from its ""Federated Learning of Cohorts"" - or ""FLoC."" Tests of FLoC's audience reach show advertisers can see at least 95% of the conversions per dollar it was getting on cookie-based advertising, Google says. That would be a boon for the ad industry overall. With privacy concerns likely spelling the end of cookie-based advertising, many publishers stated to lean into first-party data (direct from the user) - but not all publishers have the strong customer relationships needed to thrive in that arena. How is FLoC more private than cookies? It uses machine learning to create a group of thousands of people based off sites than an individual visits, and the data from that wider cohort is shared and used for ad targeting, while the local browser data is never shared. Meanwhile, Google workers have formed a global union alliance, comprising 13 different unions representing workers across 10 countries. The alliance, called Alpha Global, is affiliated to UNI Global Union and it's structured to include contractors and full-time employees. It's not yet recognized by the National Labor Relations Board, and it can't force management to negotiate.",Seeking Alpha

Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg also signed the deal with Google and told CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other executives: ""This is a big deal strategically.""The states' ""claims are inaccurate. We don't manipulate the auction,"" a Google spokesperson responded, adding that the deal wasn't secret and that Facebook participates in other ad auctions. ""There's nothing exclusive about [Facebook's] involvement and they don't receive data that is not similarly made available to other buyers."" Facebook has also disputed the allegations, saying its ad bidding arrangements promote choice and create clear benefits for advertisers, publishers and small businesses.In addition to the suit filed in Texas, Google was hit last week in a separate antitrust lawsuit joined by 38 attorneys general, which alleged that it maintained monopoly power over the internet search market, as well as an DOJ suit filed in October.",Seeking Alpha

Those two state lawsuits follow October's landmark Justice Dept. suit against the tech giant over search and search ads; Colorado AG Phil Weiser says his group will file a motion to consolidate their case with DOJ's. This latest suit, while also focused on search and search advertising, focuses on different mechanisms used to maintain power than the original DOJ suit does. It goes beyond the DOJ case, Weiser says, by looking at how Google allegedly used exclusionary contracts to tie up emerging search channels, like smart speakers.

That development realizes expectations formed a year ago when Google (GOOG +0.2%, GOOGL +0.2%) agreed to acquire Fitbit in a $2.1B deal, with an eye toward pushing its Assistant more into wearables.

Google Assistant is available on the devices in the U.S., and will roll out to other markets (including Australia, Canada, India, Ireland, New Zealand, Singapore and the UK in English) in late 2020. The devices also added audible replies from Alexa, and will make audible replies available for Google Assistant in the first half of 2021. Both devices add support for hands-free Bluetooth calling using the on-device microphone and speakers. And Fitbit has enhanced its SpO2 capability, enabling Sense and Versa 3 Premium member to track blood oxygen levels while sleeping.

Ad beats are in part the result of consumer behavioral changes that have accelerated the desire to experiment and shift advertising spend digital's way, the firm says. “Big picture, we continue to view advertising as being cyclical and see faster GDP growth leading to more ad spend across more industries ... as companies spend to reach the recovering/re-opening consumer.” Overall it's raising its ad forecast for 2020 by 8% and for 2021 by 15% - leading it to expect 11% Y/Y growth next year, and 20% in 2021. For Facebook, Morgan Stanley is expecting a bullish 29% advertising growth in Q4 and 27% next year - but those estimates don't account for contributions from Instagram Shops or Reels, two features that are taking new prominence front and center at Instagram. Those two produces could add hundred of millions of dollars in ad revenue next year, Morgan Stanley says. Google should see a recovery in travel search, while YouTube can benefit from stronger direct-response and a more stable brand ad market, it says. And as for Pinterest, at least a third of its revenue earlier this year was pure brand spend, so it should benefit as the broader brand market improves, and it will see a tailwind from automated bidding as well as other products it's building out, including performance marketing.",Seeking Alpha

The picture which emerges: the online advertising market is has been surprisingly resilient to COVID-19.Google (GOOG) / Alphabet (GOOGL): After its first ever decline in sales in Q2, Google's Q3 ad sales rose 10% y/y to $37B. YouTube's revenue was the stand-out, with a 32% increase. Google's stock rose about 8% as earnings beat estimates, and is up 21% year to date.Facebook(FB): Revenue increased 22% y/y to $21.4B, despite the ad boycott. Facebook's stock has traded down since earnings, but is still up 28% year to date.Twitter (TWTR): Ad sales grew 15% y/y to $808M. Despite strong sales growth, Twitter's stock fell 20% after announcing earnings due to weak user growth, but is still up 29% year to date.Pinterest (PINS): Sales rose 58% y/y to $443M. Pinterest's stock jumped 23% after announcing earnings due to strong revenue and user growth. The stock is up 215% year to date.Snap (SNAP): Sales rose 52% y/y to $679M. Snap's stock jumped 17% after announcing earnings and strong sales and user growth. The stock is up 141% year to date.Putting it all together: For the massive players (Google and Facebook), investors care most about revenue growth, which exceeded expectations for both companies. For the smaller players (Pinterest, Twitter and Snap), investors care most about user growth, the driver of future revenues. Pinterest and Snap jumped on strong user growth, while Twitter's disappointing user growth creamed its stock.Going forward: The resilience of these companies revenues in the face of the virus and lockdowns has driven their stock prices. Strong Q3 revenue growth across the board strengthened that phenomenon.For Premium and PRO subscribers: Despite the strength in this group of stocks, only one of them has a Very Bullish quant rating. That's concerning given the outstanding performance of Quant Ratings.

""Competition in this industry is vitally important, which is why today’s challenge against Google — the gatekeeper of the Internet — for violating antitrust laws is a monumental case both for the Department of Justice and for the American people."" ""This lawsuit strikes at the heart of Google’s grip over the Internet for millions of American consumers, advertisers, small businesses and entrepreneurs beholden to an unlawful monopolist,"" Barr continues. The DOJ complaint focuses on exclusionary agreements that ""collectively lock up the primary avenues"" through which users reach search engines, by requiring that Google be set as the default on billions of mobile devices and computers worldwide. That's a narrower scope than the complaint could have taken on, with various probes swirling around Google's approach to advertising and bundling. Those wide-ranging issues don't really come up in today's complaint. Deputy AG Jeffrey Rosen compared the suit to the department's antitrust action against AT&T in 1974, and against Microsoft in 1998. Meanwhile, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (always a tough voice on tech regulation) says the antitrust case against Google doesn't go far enough: ""Two things can both be true: Bill Barr is a corrupt Trump crony who shouldn't be AG, and @TheJusticeDept has the power to pursue a legit antitrust suit against Google. The case is clear – in fact, it could have gone further. It must move forward without political interference."" Google has responded that the lawsuit is ""deeply flawed"" and will do nothing to help consumers. ""People use Google because they choose to, not because they're forced to, or because they can't find alternatives."" The suit will ""artificially prop up lower-quality search alternatives, raise phone prices, and make it harder for people to get the search services they want to use."" The company is considering filing pretrial motions challenging the DOJ's theories, and adds ""We’re confident that a court will conclude that this suit doesn’t square with either the facts or the law.""

Oracle America, the long-running copyright dispute between Google (GOOG +0.1%, GOOGL +0.1%) and Oracle (ORCL +1.7%), and the justices initially seem wary of upending the technology industry by ruling in Oracle's favor, CNBC says. Oracle had initially sued Google for copyright infringement in 2010, alleging improper use of Oracle's Java programming language in the Android operating system. The dispute concerns about 11,500 lines of code used to build Android. Justice Stephen Breyer appeared to be the only sure vote, leaning toward Google. And while other justices including Chief Justice John Roberts appeared sympathetic to Oracle's claims, they looked reluctant to rule for Oracle after friend-of-the-court briefs argued that doing so would transform the tech industry. Justice Neil Gorsuch repeatedly raised questions about whether the lower court that sided with Oracle was sufficiently deferential to a jury finding in favor of Google, CNBC says, suggesting the court could remand the case without a definitive ruling.",Seeking Alpha

That's a fourth major antitrust challenge in India, and it coincides with a potential probe in China into the Android OS, and fresh antitrust scrutiny in the United States. India's Competition Commission has been looking into charges that Google creates barriers for firms wanting to use or develop modified versions of Android for smart TVs, such as Amazon Fire TV's operating system, according to the report. The latest case alleges Google's deals with companies like Xiaomi and TCL India stop them from using both the Android system and a modified version on different devices they make, Reuters says. Smart TVs have become increasingly popular in India; 8M smart sets were sold in the country last year, Counterpoint Research says, and three in five smart TVs sold there are based on Android.

In large part that can be credited to the small, top-heavy sector's top part playing a big part in broader market gains: Nearly half of XLC (which claims about $11.08B in net assets overall) is tied up in just two companies: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), weighted at 22.7% of the ETF, and Alphabet (GOOGL Class A at 11.3%, and GOOG Class C at 11.06%), for a combined 45% in holdings.

Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) was the top returner among key comms services names, rising more than 55%. While it rose initially off of March lows, Twitter saw its Q3 performance boosted by a trough that social media companies hit at June's end as advertisers pursued the ""Stop Hate for Profit"" digital advertising boycott - a hurdle that has been surpassed and then some in Twitter's case: Other notable gainers for the quarter were Charter Communications (CHTR, up 25%); Live Nation Entertainment (LYV, up 21%); News Corp.

(The COVID-19 world of pretaping events allows for some tight editing.) As mentioned at the beginning, so many details of the hardware had been exposed in previous weeks that the key information was the $699 price point and Oct. 15 availability for the Pixel 5.Updated 2:24 p.m.: Moving rapidly, Google says the Pixel 5 is base priced at $699. As widely expected, that's backing off a bit from the $1,000 mark, but still offering 5G capability; it's promising ""no compromise"" to bring 5G into an affordable phone. It's available Oct. 15. As expected, the Pixel 4a 5G is priced at $499.Updated 2:14 p.m.: The former Google Home smart speaker has become ""Nest Audio"" (accompanied by the puck-sized Nest Audio Mini). For $99, Nest Audio promises ""rich bass, more volume, and fuller, clearer sound"" (50% more bass than before, and 75% more volume, to be specific). In five colors, including Charcoal:Updated 2:11 p.m.: The new Chromecast adds a new dedicated remote control (older Chromecasts relied on your phone for control). It has a prominent button for the Google Assistant's voice control, and comes in colors of ""Snow, Sky and Sunrise"" (close to white, light blue and light orange, in short). It's priced at $49.99, available in U.S. today, and coming to more countries by the end of the year. Take a look:Updated 2:07 p.m.: The phones will likely go last, so first up is the new Chromecast and ""Google TV"" (replacing Android TV in concept and branding). The Google TV service promises a unified watchlist (editable from phone/laptop) and ""unlimited DVR functionality.""

The Justice Dept. and state attorneys general have been asking rival executives about pricing and operations in Google's network unit, Bloomberg reports. Making the sale of one product conditional on purchasing another isn't illegal per se, but it can be when combined with market power. And the probe is focused on discounts and special features Google uses to encourage using only its products rather than mixing and matching with rivals. It's also inquiring into how Google's online search interacts with the Network division to boost share in digital ads, according to Bloomberg. There's echoes there of whether '90s Microsoft used the dominance of the Windows operating system to force out competition in other products - and the coming antitrust suit against Google is set to be the biggest monopoly case since the case against Microsoft.",Seeking Alpha

It was big news when Disney took one of the pandemic's most anticipated tentpole releases and gave it a streaming launch set for Sept. 4 (for a $29.99 fee on top of a Disney Plus subscription). Now it's getting a wider distribution. Notably absent from the usual streaming-partner suspects: Amazon Prime Video (AMZN -0.5%). That suggests that viewers will be able to use in-app purchases on those additional platforms without a complicated workaround through Disney Plus. And LightShed's Rich Greenfield notes that means there's some economic sharing going on there with partners. Interestingly, in discussing the selection of $29.99 as a price point on top of Disney Plus' standard monthly cost, Disney CEO Bob Chapek said that Disney wasn't just drawing that $30 fee from the transaction but that it ""also acts as a fairly large stimulus to sign up for Disney Plus.""

The DOJ may sue as soon as this summer, but lawyers there concerned about an aggressive timeline favored by Attorney General William Barr are suggesting the DOJ needs more time to considering whether it has the evidence to win in court. Some of the supposed vulnerabilities in the case come in the portion that is focused on Google's search practices, according to the report. And some attorneys working on probing Google's online ad business aren't ready to move forward because of the newer complexities in that part of the case. On the other side of the issue, a senior official says harm to innovation and competition in technology markets can happen quickly, and the department must act expeditiously.

Investors can capture the outperformance of FAGAM with an S&P 500 ETF from StateStreet (NYSEARCA:SPY), iShares (NYSEARCA:IVV) or Vanguard (NYSEARCA:VOO).But in buying the S&P 500, investors are also buying hundreds of underperforming stocks. This is proved by the fact that the equal weight S&P 500 (ETF: RSP) is down year to date, while the market-cap weighted S&P 500 ETFs are up.So what's the best ETF to own the tech leaders FAGAM, without owning underperforming stocks in sectors like Energy, Industrials and Financials?The answer used to be that you could own FAGAM with the Technology Sector ETF (NYSEARCA:XLK). But GICS, the Global Industry Classification Standard, changed its classification to move Google and Facebook from the Technology Sector to the Communications Sector (ETF: XLC), and Amazon from the Technology Sector to the Consumer Discretionary Sector (ETF: XLY). As a result, investors cannot own FAGAM with a single sector ETF.The Invesco QQQ ETF ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ), which tracks the Nasdaq 100, has about 46% of its weighting in FAGAM. Its expense ratio is 0.20%, and its dividend yield is about 0.61%.The iShares Core U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG) has about 34% of its weighting in FAGAM.

Its expense ratio is 0.15%, and its dividend yield is about 1.23%. MTUM has rules to reduce concentration, and it holds other stocks with strong momentum, such as Tesla, Nvidia, and Netflix.Of the three ETFs, the Invesco QQQ ETF ETF (QQQ) has the by far strongest price increase year to date at about 25%, followed by the iShares Core U.S. Growth ETF (IUSG) at about 14% and the iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (MTUM) at about 12%. Not surprisingly, the year to date performance ranking of these ETFs tracks their concentration in FAGAM. All three of these ETFs comfortably beat the S&P 500 ETFs SPY, IVV and VOO, which are up a measly 1.5% year to date. Note that MTUM has the same concentration in FAGAM as the S&P 500 ETFs, but has massively outperformed them.Momentum investors looking to own a concentrated position in FAGAM don't need an ETF. They can just buy Facebook, Amazon, Google, Apple and Microsoft directly. With zero trading commissions and narrow spreads on these massively traded stocks, the cost to buy and sell them is negligible.If, on the other hand, an investor wants a more diversified portfolio that captures momentum stocks wherever they are over time, MTUM offers that.

News' value to google is ""not economic - it's societal,"" says Google News VP Richard Gingras. ""The value of news to Google is about informing and educating, not economics. Nearly all of our revenue comes not from news queries, but from queries with commercial intent, like someone searching for a new 'toaster' and clicking on an ad."" But when it comes to repaying publishers for the news they provide, he notes: ""Sending people to publishers' news sites - not keeping them 'walled' up on Google products, as some claim - is a key way we provide value to the news industry. Every month we send Google users to news sites 24 billion times, providing an opportunity for publishers to grow their audiences and show Google’s users ads or offers for subscriptions."" Deloitte values each click for large publishers at between $0.04-$0.07, he says. And the company's analysis shows that news publishers keep over 95% of the digital ad revenue the generate when they use Google Ad Manager.
