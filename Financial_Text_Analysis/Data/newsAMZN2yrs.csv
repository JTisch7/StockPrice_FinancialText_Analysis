As a result of the DoD fixing just one of many errors, the pricing differential swung substantially, with AWS now the lowest-priced bid by tens of millions of dollars. The fact that correcting just one error can move the needle that substantially demonstrates why it’s important that the DoD fix all of the evaluation errors that remain unaddressed, and ensure they are getting access to the best technology at the best price. We had made clear that unless the DoD addressed all of the defects in its initial decision, we would continue to pursue a fair and objective review, and that’s exactly where we find ourselves today.""Now the Pentagon says the judge should dismiss Amazon Web Services' ""waived bias allegations because AWS was aware of all the facts on which it bases these allegations well prior to both the original award and prior to DOD reaffirming the award on remand.""According to a government filing via Bloomberg, the Pentagon says that Amazon ""declined to raise these allegations until after it learned that its proposal had been rejected.""Previously: Amazon says bid for Pentagon cloud contract was superior to Microsoft (Dec. 15 2020)",Seeking Alpha

When Amazon DevOps Guru identifies anomalous application behavior (e.g. increased latency, error rates, resource constraints, etc.) that could cause potential outages or service disruptions, it alerts developers with issue details (e.g. resources involved, issue timeline, related events, etc.) via Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) and partner integrations like Atlassian Opsgenie and PagerDuty to help them quickly understand the potential impact and likely causes of the issue with specific recommendations for remediation. Developers can use remediation suggestions from Amazon DevOps Guru to reduce time to resolution when issues arise and improve application availability and reliability with no manual setup or machine learning expertise required. There are no upfront costs or commitments with Amazon DevOps Guru, and customers pay only for the data Amazon DevOps Guru analyzes.

(AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced five new Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, two new AWS Outposts form factors, and three new AWS Local Zones locations that extend its lead in offering the broadest and deepest portfolio of compute offerings in the cloud. AWS already has more compute instance types than any other cloud provider, with instances based on the fastest processors from Intel, cost-optimized instances with AMD processors, the most powerful GPU instances from NVIDIA, instances that feature up to 400 Gbps networking performance, and the only Arm-based instances in the cloud offering customers 40% better price performance with AWS-designed AWS Graviton2 processors. AWS Outposts is unique in the industry as it enables customers who want to run AWS on-premises to do so with the same Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), tools, and hardware that they use to run AWS in AWS’s Regions. AWS Local Zones gives customers who need low latency infrastructure in major metropolitan areas but don’t want to provision or maintain datacenter space in those locales the ability to use AWS in these metropolitan areas. Today’s announcement provides even more options for customers looking to choose the best compute for their unique needs.

""This case concerns state and federal guidance addressing workplace safety during a pandemic for which there is no immediate end in sight. Regulating in the age of COVID-19 is a dynamic and fact-intensive matter fraught with medical and scientific uncertainty. There is room for significant disagreement as to the necessity or wisdom of any particular workplace policy or practice. Courts are not expert in public health or workplace safety matters, and lack the training, expertise, and resources to oversee compliance with evolving industry guidance.""""The Court's decision to grant Amazon's motion to dismiss the claims of workers at the company's JFK8 facility is devastating for the health and safety of Amazon workers nationwide,"" said the legal team for the plaintiffs, which are weighing an appeal of the decision. ""The Court's deference to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration should be very concerning to anyone who cares about the health of American workers, given that OSHA has been virtually AWOL throughout this crisis.""""Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our employees, which is why at the onset of the pandemic we moved quickly to make more than 150 COVID-19 related process changes,"" responded Amazon spokesperson Lisa Levandowsk.

1330,2020-09-23 05:53:00-07:00,"Nike jump, Amazon rebound lifting discretionary out of doldrums: At the Open","The Consumer Discretionary sector is extending gains, benefiting again from e-commerce success surpassing brick-and-mortar weakness.The SPDR Consumer Discretionary Sector ETF (XLY, +1%) is among the best-performing sectors ahead of trading. That’s thanks largely due to a large post-earnings jump in Nike (NKE, +12%).Nike shares are hitting all-time highs. It said in its report out yesterday that brand digital sales rose 82% during the quarter to help offset lower revenue in the wholesale business and Nike-owned stores.XLY topped the leader board at the close yesterday, rising 2.1%. The big drive was Amazon (AMZN, -0.3%), up 5.6%, helped by an upgrade. Amazon shares came through a big test of its 100-day simple moving average, bouncing back above $3,000 per share.XLY hasn’t risen that much since July 6, when it rose nearly 2.4%. Again, Amazon was the big winner, riding a four-day momentum rally to gain nearly 5.8% and breach $3,000/share for the first time.Consumer Discretionary has become a volatile and disparate sector during the pandemic. Amazon and its $1.5T+ market cap dominates. There are the companies adapting quickly to digital demand, like Nike, Target (TGT, +0.1%) and Best Buy (BBY, +0.1%). There are those tied to the hot housing sector like (LEN, +0.2%) and Home Depot (HD, +0.5%). And there are the volatile stocks relying on a post-pandemic recovery, which could be up or down 5% on any given day on headlines, such as Royal Caribbean (RCL, +1.7%), up 162% in the last six months, or Nordstrom (JWN, +0.9%), down 27% in that time and one of just two stocks in the red. Despite its big exposure to the megacap selloff, XLY is down just 6% from its Sept. 2 closing high of $153.76. Amazon is still in correction territory from that time, down 11.4%.Yesterday, XLY bounced back above its 50-day SMA, which it had dipped below on Monday. Its relative strength index is at 47.73 and had hit about 40 on Monday, the lowest level its seen since the beginning of April.At 2 p.m. ET, Old Navy President Nancy Green will give a talk at the Recode Code Commerce @home event. She’s expected to update on the huge amount of mask sales the company is generating and pandemic trends with casual clothing and new online channels.Old Navy parent Gap (GPS, +1.1%) is up 131% in the last six months, but still in the red, off about 5.5%, year to date.Sector WatchThe SPDR Financial Sector ETF (XLF, +0.3%) is edging up before the bell, trying to break its current streak of four-straight losing days. It’s been down five out of the last six sessions.Rates have been stuck in neutral, not having too much of an effect. But the sector may be struggling from a belief that increasing COVID cases and no signs of further fiscal stimulus could have the market reverting back to the relative safety and earnings of big tech.Further comments from Fed chief Jerome Powell today on the need for fiscal action could have an impact. The Fed’s Loretta Mester and Charles Evans also speak today. “I would say the positive here is that you do have bipartisan agreement saying more fiscal is necessary, you have the Fed saying more fiscal is necessary, so it’s quite different form where we were in 2011 and 2012 when there was a real debate over should we do more fiscal,” Citi chief economist Andrew Hollenhorst told Bloomberg. “Everyone agrees we should do more fiscal and unfortunately the politics is standing in the way of that right now.”See more market-moving events at Seeking Alpha's Catalyst Watch.",Seeking Alpha

Investors can capture the outperformance of FAGAM with an S&P 500 ETF from StateStreet (NYSEARCA:SPY), iShares (NYSEARCA:IVV) or Vanguard (NYSEARCA:VOO).But in buying the S&P 500, investors are also buying hundreds of underperforming stocks. This is proved by the fact that the equal weight S&P 500 (ETF: RSP) is down year to date, while the market-cap weighted S&P 500 ETFs are up.So what's the best ETF to own the tech leaders FAGAM, without owning underperforming stocks in sectors like Energy, Industrials and Financials?The answer used to be that you could own FAGAM with the Technology Sector ETF (NYSEARCA:XLK). But GICS, the Global Industry Classification Standard, changed its classification to move Google and Facebook from the Technology Sector to the Communications Sector (ETF: XLC), and Amazon from the Technology Sector to the Consumer Discretionary Sector (ETF: XLY). As a result, investors cannot own FAGAM with a single sector ETF.The Invesco QQQ ETF ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ), which tracks the Nasdaq 100, has about 46% of its weighting in FAGAM. Its expense ratio is 0.20%, and its dividend yield is about 0.61%.The iShares Core U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG) has about 34% of its weighting in FAGAM.

MTUM has rules to reduce concentration, and it holds other stocks with strong momentum, such as Tesla, Nvidia, and Netflix.Of the three ETFs, the Invesco QQQ ETF ETF (QQQ) has the by far strongest price increase year to date at about 25%, followed by the iShares Core U.S. Growth ETF (IUSG) at about 14% and the iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (MTUM) at about 12%. Not surprisingly, the year to date performance ranking of these ETFs tracks their concentration in FAGAM. All three of these ETFs comfortably beat the S&P 500 ETFs SPY, IVV and VOO, which are up a measly 1.5% year to date. Note that MTUM has the same concentration in FAGAM as the S&P 500 ETFs, but has massively outperformed them.Momentum investors looking to own a concentrated position in FAGAM don't need an ETF. They can just buy Facebook, Amazon, Google, Apple and Microsoft directly. With zero trading commissions and narrow spreads on these massively traded stocks, the cost to buy and sell them is negligible.If, on the other hand, an investor wants a more diversified portfolio that captures momentum stocks wherever they are over time, MTUM offers that.

While SPY is up 5.9% versus a month ago, Apple is up 16.51%, Amazon 14.71%, and Facebook 11.71%.

That was up 29% from the year-ago period, but just shy of estimates of $11B.That indicates that Amazon’s big beat came from home shopping, not surprising as the quarter covered the worst months of the pandemic lockdown. The strength of e-commerce was further illustrated by the performance of other online retailers, although that may have gone largely unnoticed with all eyes on Amazon.The Amplify Online Retail ETF (NASDAQ:IBUY), which does not hold Amazon, rose 10.7% this past week.The momentum of IBUY has been strong, up 20% in an month, 64% in 6 months and 64.2% year to date, all blowing past the gains of the S&P. Amazon is up 71.3% year to date.The ETF is comfortably above the 50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages. But the RSI stands at 75.33, just in overbought territory, about where it has been since lockdown measures began.IBUY benefited from a very strong week for its top holding, Overstock (NASDAQ:OSTK), which makes up 3.93% of the fund.Overstock rose more than 42% this past week thanks to a huge top-line beat where its online retail business doubled, with Q2 revenue coming in at $782.54M. That blew past expectations of $102M. Shares are up a staggering 972% year to date.The trend looks bullish even with the price surge, with institutional money pouring into stay-at-home names.“Overstock.com appears to be a highly competitive current capital gain prospect. Its near-term opportunity arising from the speed of its achievement of prior price gain forecasts seems to be a reasonable time investment speculation,” Peter F.

Indeed, PC shipments were up 11% y/y in Q2, with HP (NYSE:HPQ) and Lenovo leading the way. But the concentration of value in big tech led some to indicate investors may have gotten ahead of themselves, so much so, that Fundstrat's Tom Lee last week opted to dispute such a characterization of the mega-cap tech's concentration in the S&P 500. Sitting then at 22% of the S&P 500's market cap, he argued that the companies comprise 18% of the S&P's earnings and are more than 80% of earnings growth, showing investors may not be out of step with fundamentals after all, despite the fact that the names led most of the market cap-weighted S&P's recovery from the March lows.Some indications are that investors were beginning to look for alternatives, as JPMorgan's program trading desk started to see interest from more investors of a willingness to move to the equal-weighted S&P (NYSEARCA:RSP). Right on cue as investors began to shift sentiment, big tech surged with numbers to back up the rally.Apple delivered with revenue growth over 10%, led by the iPhone, while Amazon and Facebook also delivered. Amazon's revenue was up 40%, outpacing last quarter's 23% y/y growth. Facebook's growth last quarter was in excess of 20%, and notched 11% y/y growth in its latest quarter.Find Amazon's growth metrics here, Apple's growth measures and comparisons here and Facebook's at this link.

2092,2020-07-21 08:18:00-07:00,Tesla looks pricey vs. Apple and Amazon at the $300B marker,"As you may have noticed Tesla (TSLA -0.8%) has been bid up to a market cap of over $300B in a rush of investors bets on the company's role in EV disruption. Amid that backdrop, Morgan Stanley is out with a note today comparing a $300B Tesla to where Apple (AAPL -0.3%) and Amazon (AMZN -1.9%) stood historically at the same market cap. ""Tesla is less than half the size of Apple in revenue and roughly 1/5th the EBITDA of Apple at that time. Compared to Amazon’s $300bn crossing in late 2015, Tesla today is 70% smaller by revenue with about 1/3rd the EBITDA. Tesla’s $300bn milestone reflects a significant valuation premium vis-à-vis when Apple and Amazon achieved the same cap. At $300bn, Tesla trades at roughly 61x our forward year EBITDA estimate. Apple’s valuation when it crossed $300bn in early 2011 was 11x forward year EV/EBITDA. Amazon’s valuation on the same metric in November 2015 was 22.4x. Tesla’s EV/EBITDA multiple is nearly 6-fold that of Apple and roughly 3-fold Amazon when they achieved the milestone,"" writes analyst Adam Jonas. Jonas observes that an inflation of the S&P 500 market multiple in general helps explain some of the valuation premium for Tesla (S&P P/E 70% higher vs. Apple and 33% vs. AMZN). Then, while harder to quantify, he surmises that Tesla is garnering greater levels of enthusiasm from investors given its technological dominance and points to the overlay of important ESG/climate related factors may also be a contributing influence. There is a myriad of other reasons to pitch the Tesla $300B case as well.Still, Apple hit $300B in market cap on the heels of a two-year streak of +50% revenue growth and Amazon showed profitability improvement in AWS and retail to justify its run to $300B. Of course, the $300B threshold was just a pit stop on the way to a +$1B market cap for both companies and those in the Tesla bull camp are looking for the company to see accelerating growth.",Seeking Alpha

Today’s gains are looking more broad-based, but the sector could shine again as eBay joins the rally.The SPDR Consumer Discretionary Sector (XLY, +1.2%) is rising before hours as work-from-home equities continue to enjoy favor this week.eBay (EBAY, +1.2%) is catching a bid following its agreement to sell its classifieds business for $9.2B in cash and stock.The deal follows its sale of StubHub, completed this year, as it looks to get leaner and focus on its core business following pressure from activist hedge funds. eBay also will keep a minority stake in the combined classifieds company.The online auction company is benefiting from the enthusiasm for stay-at-home retail embodied by Amazon (AMZN, +2%) which is also higher premarket. Amazon looked vulnerable for the first time since the early lockdown days last week, falling five sessions in a row. But the stock is set to have wiped out all of its losses from last week at the open today, thanks in no small part to two Street-high price target boosts from Goldman and Jefferies yesterday.As things stand now, shares would be up nearly 2% from their close on Friday, July 10.The XLY has been outperforming the broader market in the past month and 6 months. But that’s not just a megacap phenomenon. Even excluding Amazon, the SPDR Retail (NYSEARCA:XRT) is performing better than the S&P over 6 months.The leading stock in the Consumer Discretionary sector before the bell today is Tapestry (TPR, +3.9%), owner of the Coach and Kate Spade brands. CEO Jide Zeitlin has resigned from the company and board for personal reasons and CFO Joanne Crevoiserat has been appointed interim chief executive.Shares haven’t really made a move since the early-pandemic dive and are down more than 50% in the past 6 months.Sector WatchEnergy sat out yesterday’s rally, down 1.7%, despite a rally from Halliburton (HAL, +5%) on earnings (it's up again premarket), and Jefferies upgrading midstream and refining names, predicting better operating rates.A lot of the decline was Chevron’s drop as the acquiring company for Noble Energy.

Amazon IVS uses the same technology that powers Twitch, one of the most popular live streaming services in the world with nearly 10 billion hours of video watched in 2019, giving customers live content with latency (the time video takes to go from the camera to the viewer) that can be less than three seconds (significantly lower than the 20-30 second latencies common with online streaming video today). Customers can easily configure and stream live video through their own website or mobile application, with scalable delivery that supports millions of concurrent viewers globally. With the Amazon IVS SDK and APIs, customers can also build interactive features into their live streams like virtual chat spaces, votes and polls, moderated question and answer sessions, and synchronized promotional elements. There are no additional charges or upfront commitments required to use Amazon IVS, and customers pay only for video input to Amazon IVS and video output delivered to viewers.

""First, both Netflix and Amazon are reaching scale in movie output. We estimate that Netflix put out ~60 English language movies in 2019 vs. 131 wide releases by the Major 6 (87) and other studios (44). Many of these, like The Irishman or Extraction are big-budget films that would typically be seen as box office blockbusters. Second, movie theater chains are distressed due to COVID-19 and social distancing. Finally, competition in maturing markets like the US is rising, with most major media houses we cover set to offer a subscription service by the end of 2020. Bundling movie theater access with a membership could serve as a differentiator."" The firm thinks theatrical distribution can work with an over-the-top streaming model, despite the long-held emphasis of streaming execs on the immediate release of content to consumers at home. A potential hurdle for Amazon or Netflix owning a chain would be resistance from Disney (NYSE:DIS), Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA), Warner Bros. (NYSE:T) and Universal (NASDAQ:CMCSA), although their leverage could be tamped down due to the pandemic strain. BofA has a Buy rating on both Amazon and Netflix.

Crucible is following a well-worn path of free-to-play games that make money by selling digital merchandise and seasonal battle passes, while New World is expected to price at $40 for a standard edition and $50 for deluxe. Those games will indicate whether Amazon can make revenue and talent-poaching inroads against established publishers (led by Activision Blizzard (ATVI +1.2%), Electronic Arts (EA +1.9%) and Take-Two (TTWO +2.6%)), as well as build momentum for Amazon's hopeful entry into full game-streaming as a rival to Google Stadia (GOOG +2.2%, GOOGL +2.2%).

""We cannot help but wonder whether the news is symptomatic of broader delivery issues that AMZN’s own network might be facing as we approach the final days of what is an already compressed peak season – particularly given the added constraints of one-day shipping and fewer external carrier options (non-renewal of FDX Express/Ground contracts),"" notes the firm. ""While weather was partly responsible for delays during Cyber week for most carriers, AMZN also cited high demand/record orders as resulting in longer than normal delivery times based on constrained fulfillment and delivery capacity in certain areas. In our view, this underscores the idiosyncratic challenges that AMZN’s less mature in-house delivery capabilities face relative to the well-established, end-to-end hub networks at both FDX and UPS."" The conclusion is that there is the possibility that a classic diversion tactic was in play with the partial ban by Amazon on FedEx yesterday. Shares of FDX are down 1.16% premarket to $162.20. AMZN is up 0.38%.Previously: FedEx lower after Amazon bans certain deliveries (Dec. 16)",Seeking Alpha

(AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced the general availability of Amazon Textract, a fully managed service that uses machine learning to automatically extract text and data, including from tables and forms, in virtually any document without the need for manual review, custom code, or machine learning experience. Amazon Textract goes beyond simple optical character recognition (OCR) to identify the contents of fields in forms, information stored in tables, and the context in which the information is presented, such as a name or social security number from a tax form or the product SKU or quantity in a warehouse from an inventory report. The extracted text and data can be easily used to build smart searches on large archives of documents, or can be loaded into a database for use by applications, such as accounting, auditing, and compliance software. Amazon Textract’s API supports multiple image formats like scans, PDFs, and photos, and customers can use it with database and analytics services like Amazon Elasticsearch Service, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon Athena and other machine learning services like Amazon Comprehend, Amazon Comprehend Medical, Amazon Translate, and Amazon SageMaker to derive deeper meaning from the extracted text and data.
