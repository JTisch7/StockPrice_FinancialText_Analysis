# Project.ipynb   
A notebook with everything from start to finish including data extraction and preparation, sentiment analysis and model exploration, and putting it all together with classis models, ensembles, and RNNs - https://github.com/JTisch7/StockPrice_FinancialText_Analysis/blob/main/Project.ipynb

### Bert_HuggingFaceTransformers :  
A BERT model from Hugging Face Transformers. Uses first token of last_hidden_state as output to some dense layers and a classification layer on top. Has code that can be used to change the layers within the bert layer to trainable or not, as well as the layer as a whole or any other layers.

### Creating_A_FinBert :  
explores how to fine-tune, save, and load a BERT model for financial sentiment analysis (final model achieved over 96% accuracy on the Financial PhraseBank dataset)

### GloVe_WordEmbeddings :  
This model illustrates the use of pre-trained word vectors from GloVe to initialize an embedding layer (can be fine-tuned or used as is). The model is first trained for a few epochs while the embedding layer is frozen. Then, after unfreezing the embedding layer, the model is further trained using a lower learning rate.

### HuggingFace_PreTrained_FinBERT :  
a pretrained and ready-to-go model for financial sentiment analysis from Hugging Face Transformers

### Multi_Input_Network :  
explores a neural network architecture that takes in both text and numerical data

### SimpleTextEmbedding :  
explores a network that utilizes a simple embedding layer for text data

### Two_Berts :  
explores using two BERT models concatenated together

### Data :  
data used in analysis financial text analysis
